# Rustly

A Clojure to Rust transpiler.

![orange leaves](https://cdn.britannica.com/18/196818-131-84946E03.jpg)


## Usage

`lein run --in <src.clj> --out <out.rs>`


## Example

Run the example with `./hello_world.sh`

This shell script invokes the transpiler with input file
[example/hello_world/hello-world.clj](example/hello_world/hello-world.clj),
produces output file [example/hello_world/src/main.rs](example/hello_world/src/main.rs),
invokes `cargo run`,
producing the "Ferris says hello" message:

    ----------------------------
    | Hello world              |
    ----------------------------
              \
               \
                  _~^~^~_
              \) /  o o  \ (/
                '_   -   _'
                / '-----' \


## Status

This is a science project.
This software is alpha and subject to changes.
Feedback on design and implementation is welcome.
Only a subset of Clojure is implemented.
The goal is to cover all the good parts.

No packaged builds are provided at this time.
To use this transpiler you must download the source code.

See [Kalai](https://github.com/echeran/kalai) for a more actively maintained Clojure->Rust transpiler.

## Rationale

The thing that might be awesome about compiling Clojure to Rust code is that we can target platforms like WASM or native.

Seeing the terrific stuff that Rust to WASM people are producing (https://makepad.github.io/makepad/)
makes me think that having a concise Lisp syntax in that ecosystem would be a good thing.


## Developing

Contributions in the form of issues, PRs, and suggestions are very welcome.

The interesting bits are in [src/rustly/transpiler.clj](src/rustly/transpile.clj),
where Clojure forms are translated to Rust code.
